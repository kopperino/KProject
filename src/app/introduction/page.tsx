        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>K is an original animation series filled with mysteries upon mysteries. The story is set 
            in a slightly different modern day Japan, where 7 Kings each have their own feuds and alliances.
            A young highschool student somehow finds himself involved in a battle between people with unbelievable 
            powers. The story is created by the GoRA, 7 masked authors, who have carefully drawn up a story that includes
            the unique writing ability of each of the GoRA members. The animation is done by 'GoHands', the same studio behind
            Mardock Scramble. The show is directed and features character designs by Shingo Suzuki, and features music from
            Mikio Endo (Guilty Honey) and animation direction by Makoto Furuta (Seitokai Yakuindomo) - a truly amazing group of staff!

            The cast of the show features many popular voice actors including Daisuke Namikawa, Daisuke Ono, Mikako Komatsu,
            Kenjiro Tsuda, and Tomokazu Sugita. The opening theme is sung by Angela and ending by Mikako Komatsu, both of which
            are attracting lots of attention. Together with the start of the broadcast, a manga version of the show by Yui Kuroe
            will be serialised in Kodansha ARIA - the manga will be titled 'K -Memory of Red-' and will tell the prelude of the anime's
            story line. Additionally, from Novemeber the novel based around the series, created by GoRA, will be available in three volumes.
            The series will be available over a number of media for fans to enjoy.
